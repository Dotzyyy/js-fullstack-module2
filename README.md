# js-fullstack-module2 - BoardGamers website

## Concept
The initial plan with BoardGamers was to create a marketplace or news site geared towards the topic of Boardgames and tabletop games.
Due to the limited scope of the assignment it has been drawn back to a few visual elements and examples of JavaScript code in action.

## Features

### Slideshow

The slideshow displays four images that can be switched to any given image's direct neighbour using the arrow buttons or to any of the images the user wishes using the thumbnail circles.

### Nav-Button

The Nav-Button appears when the viewport reaches a small enough size and contains the navigation bar. When activated, the navbar will appear below the button.

### Collapsible Section

On the About and FAQ pages I have included a few hidden information sections that the user can activate in order to collapse/show the information.

### Form

The Form on display is a basic layout, meant to mimic an actual contact form. Depending on how the user enters the information, the window will display a message in order inform them of whether they have successfully entered their information. There is also a message after not enetering any information at all.

### Light/Dark Mode

The bottom of each page contains a button that will switch the colour scheme from dark to light, although it is more limited in scope than I had originally planned as it only affects the background colour and nav-button colour.
